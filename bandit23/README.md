## Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

- NOTE:<br/> Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

## Commands you may need to solve this level:
| command | Explanation |
| ------|-----|
| cron | Explanation |
| crontab | opens the cron table for editing  |



## Let's try
To find the pincode we have to try all of the 10000 combinations..that's crazy
Looks like it's time to use what we've learned with the shell script....let's have fun
First we have to connect to the server then let the script do its work by trying all 10000 combinations
