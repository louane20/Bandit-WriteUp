## Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

- NOTE:<br/> Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

## Commands you may need to solve this level:
| command | Explanation |
| ------|-----|
| cron | Explanation |
| crontab | opens the cron table for editing  |


## Let's have fun

Well.. in the previous level we used the shell script, but our use of it was superficial so we did not go into depth with it.. but the note added to this level dely used because it has more features, is well developed and better syntax.

## Let's try
