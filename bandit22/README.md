## Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

- NOTE:<br/> Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

## Commands you may need to solve this level:
| command | Explanation |
| ------|-----|
| cron | Explanation |
| crontab | opens the cron table for editing  |


## Let's have fun

Well.. in the previous level we used the shell script, but our use of it was superficial so we did not go into depth with it.. but the note added to this level indicates that we need to understand it well..

- What is shell script?<br/>
A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a UNIX-based operating system. It is called a shell script because it combines a sequence of commands, that would otherwise have to be typed into the keyboard one at a time, into a single script. The shell is the operating system's command-line interface (CLI) and interpreter for the set of commands that are used to communicate with the system.

- How shell scripting works?
The basic steps involved with shell scripting are writing the script, making the script accessible to the shell and giving the shell execute permission.

Shell scripts contain ASCII text and are written using a text editor, word processor or graphical user interface (GUI). The content of the script is a series of commands in a language that can be interpreted by the shell. Functions that shell scripts support include loops, variables, if/then/else statements, arrays and shortcuts. Once complete, the file is saved typically with a .txt or .sh extension and in a location that the shell can access.

- (#!/bin/bash ) What exactly is this ?
